    <h4>
        <p>Embutido, which is the Spanish word for sausage, is another Filipino dish of Hispanic origin. Filipino embutido is our version of meatloaf and is considered one of the most favorite dishes in any feasts or special occasions. Mothers used to make this for birthday celebrations, Christmas, New Year, and fiesta. But you need not wait for special occasions to make this. It’s very easy to prepare. Just mix everything together in a bowl, roll mixture into a log on a sheet of aluminum foil and steam. You can also make this ahead of time and just store the steamed embutido in the freezer.</p>
        <p>The origin of Filipino Style Embutido can be traced when Spain colonized the Philippines for three and a half centuries beginning in the middle of the 15th century. During that time, the Spaniards introduced different recipes of their sausages such as Chorizo, Longaniza, and Embutido. It’s for this reason why Embutido is regarded as a generic term for sausages in the Spanish language. In other words, “Embutido” belongs to a category of sausage recipes during the Spanish colonial period.</p>
        <p>Embutido can be served as cold cuts or you can slice then fry it until the edges get lightly seared to a delicious crisp. I love it with sweet chili sauce while filipinos likes dipping it in barbecue sauce.But with or without sauce, it’s so delicious! You should try it!
