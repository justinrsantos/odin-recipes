    <h4><p>Lumpiang Shanghai is a Filipino-style spring roll made of ground pork, chicken or beef filling wrapped in thin crepes called lumpia wrappers.</p>
        <p>The meat-stuffed lumpia is rolled into a thin cylindrical shape, cut into bite-size lengths and deep-fried to golden perfection. It's traditionally enjoyed with a choice of dipping sauces such as sweet and sour, lechon sarsa, banana ketchup, and sweet chili. </p>
        <p>While it’s a popular mainstay in Filipino gatherings and celebrations alongside pancit guisado, spaghetti, and other party fares, it’s also commonly served with steamed or fried rice for breakfast, lunch, or dinner as well as a midday snack.</p>

    Ingredients
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground chicken or pork</li>
        <li>1/2 cup green onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 can (8 ounces) water chestnuts, drained and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, peeled and shredded</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>20 pieces spring roll wrappers</li>
        <li>canola oil</li>
    </ul>
    Directions
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine ground chicken, green onions, water chestnuts, carrots, garlic, soy sauce, salt, and pepper until well distributed.</li>
        <li>Separate wrappers into individual sheets and lay on a flat working surface.</li>
        <li>Spoon about 1 heaping tablespoon of meat mixture on the lower end of the wrapper, closest to you.</li>
        <li>Fold the bottom of wrapper over filling and continue to roll tightly into a thin log about 3/4-inch thick. Wet the remaining edge of the wrapper with a dab of water to completely seal.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining mixture. Using scissors, cut each lumpia roll into about 3-inch lengths.</li>
        <li>In a pan over medium heat, heat about 2-inch deep of oil. Add lumpia in batches and cook turning on sides as needed, for about 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown and crisp and meat is cooked through. </li>
        <li>Using a slotted spoon or tongs, remove from the oil and drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Serve immediately with sweet and sour sauce or banana ketchup. </li>
    </ol>
